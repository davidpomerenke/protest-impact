## Conclusion

I find the following answers to my research questions:

__How well do the methods work and how do they compare to each other?__ The instrumental variable method is not suitable for my setting of measuring the impact of single events because most instruments are very weak, and the only strong instrument clearly fails the placebo checks. The other three methods -- regression, inverse propensity weighting, and synthetic control -- all reduce bias in comparison to simple correlation. IPW exhibits consistent bias in both types of placebo tests. Regression shows bias in outcome placebo tests; the bias has weekly patterns, suggesting insufficient interaction modeling that may also involve other variables than only weekdays. The synthetic control method is relatively unbiased in placebo tests but also shows some weekly bias in outcome placebo tests. It estimates an increase in coverage already before a protest event happens; this is acceptable only if (a) this coverage anticipates the event rather than triggers it, and (b) one accepts a definition of a protest event that includes certain pre-event activity. Under these conditions and under further limitations discussed in @sec-disc-synth, the synthetic control method gives plausible causal estimates. The other methods give clearly biased results in my setting, but this may be improved.

__What is the general ATT and what are the ATTs for the protest groups?__ According to the synthetic control method -- which is not clearly valid -- the ATT on cumulative regional newspaper converage in the first week after the protests is 7.XX±X.XX. The ATTs for the individual groups are ... (not significant?) TODO

__Do protests distract from constructive discussion of the climate crisis?__ According to the synthetic control method -- which is not clearly valid -- the ATT is positive (according to synthetic control) or close to zero (according to regression) for the number of articles that do not mention any protest activity. This suggests that there is no backfiring effect on constructive discussion, but the results are not statistically significant at p=0.05. This also holds specifically for _Fridays for Future_ and for _Greenpeace_. For _Letzte Generation_ and _Ende Gelände_ the results suggest a non-significant decrease in coverage that does not mention protest articles; further research, for example using full texts, would be necessary to determine whether this distracts from constructive discussion. For _Extinction Rebellion_ there is a significant increase in coverage that does not mention protest activity; if the synthetic control method is valid, this is strong evidence that they do not distract from constructive discussion. (However, not adjusted for multiple testing so far TODO)

### Future work

__Extending the scope of the content.__ The methods can be applied to national newspaper coverage, social media data, or parliamentary speech [see @sec-data-discourse]. Topic models (see @chenHowClimateMovement2023a) can be used to get finer insights into the impact on different topics.

__Improving the causal methods:__

- Causal random forests [@wagerEstimationInferenceHeterogeneous2017] can be used for flexibly modeling interactions.
- Weak instrumental variable beyond maximum likelihood limited information (LIML) can be investigated, for example Fieller–Anderson–Rubin confidence intervals [@dingFirstCourseCausal2023, ch.21.4, ch. 23.6.3]
- For the synthetic control method, rolling average estimation can be tried out, as well as fitting for the anticipation effect. The extent of bias from missing data can be estimated using simulations. (See @sec-disc-synth.)
- The propensity score method can be improved by (a) using dedicated time-series models and (b) using small or large language models for the estimation of propensity scores (see @sec-disc-ps). Problems with the doubly robust method should be investigated in more depth.
- Double machine learning [@chernozhukovDoubleDebiasedMachine2017] is a promising nonparametric method to improve on both regression and propensity score models, using ideas from the two-stage least squares instrumental variable method.

### Societal implications

Given my methods, it is not possible to obtain clearly unbiased results. The estimates by the synthetic control method are probably least biased. They weakly suggest that protests generally do _not_ backfire by distracting from the general discourse on climate policy and the climate crisis. This implies that protests may indeed be a suitable tool for drawing attention to their concern, at least in the case of climate protests in Germany from 2020-2022, with the possible exception of specific protest groups. The results also suggest that the various protest groups have very different effects on media coverage. Improving the causal methods may help to make less biased and more significant statements about these issues. It must also be noted that the results apply to regional newspaper coverage due to methodical reasons, but the focus of many protest groups may be on national newspaper coverage.

A more actionable result is that naive media impact evaluation evaluation methods do not work:

- Only counting the number of articles that explicitly mention a protest event or protest group ignores the impact on the articles that do not do so, and this impact may be substantial -- positively or negatively.
- A correlation-based analysis is highly biased, and even an optimized regression analysis is somewhat biased. This applies to the absolute numbers as well as to comparisons between different topics, and potentially between different protest groups.
- Even the best causal method used here exhibits many methodical flaws, but there is a lot of potential for improvement in future work.

Protest groups and funding bodies that care about quantitative media impact evaluation should therefore invest into the advancement of causal methods and their application to protest events.

<!--

Discussion interprets the results and places them in terms of the state-of-the-art.

Interpretation of findings (e.g. in terms of a) research ethics b) limitation of the research methodology):
Excellent and critical discussion and or reflection on all findings vis-a-vis existing research. Attention for research limitations and concrete suggestions for further research. Conclusions have been based on results, and have been taken to a higher level.

## Discussion

### Regression

- bias in time-series: probably not too much of a problem
- placebo outcome: not good, omitted variable bias or nonlinear relations
- placebo treatment: relatively reasonable
- impact: clearly converges, very plausible

### Instrumental variables

- weird finding that the weather is not relevant, compare with literature
- wald estimates: not reliable; we can take correlation as a lower limit
- interpret principal components: weather, especially seasonal one; unclear, movement?
- interpret deseasoned principal components: movement?; weather and stringency -> going outside?; weather
- problem: how to argue for not really interpretable components?
- first stage: plausible
- order of magnitude completely unreasonable
- placebo tests seem roughly reasonable for the protest articles but not others -- this might be a weak instrument issue
- future work: use other weak variable methods such as Ding, that are only implemented in r
- related work probably relies on seasonal effect, which may be legitimate with controlling, whcih they do! alternative in the absence of clear instruments might also be double machine learning

### Synthetic control

- good that we can optimiza unbiased
- tradeoff bias v direct pre-treatment fit, see discussion of anticipation
- placebo outcome: anticipation effects, weekly patterns
  - alternative: rolling averages, difficult to retrieve absolute effects; or weekly aggregates
- placebo treatment: very reasonable
- impact: converges somewhat, somewhat reasonable

__Bias from incomplete protest data in synthetic control:__

- Difficulties with small protest events
- Difficulties with large protest events

### Propensity scores

- not good enough, biased towards correlation
- placebo tests (both): uniform bias; if this was zero, it would be very plausible
- doubly robust is weird; rather use double ml?
- disappointing that F1 is so low -- use text
  - experiments indicate

### General issues

- Anticipation effects {#sec-anticip} [@abadieSyntheticControlMethods2010]: weekly patters in regression
- problem of not enough interaction terms / heterogeneity -> use CRForests, DML

### Impact estimates

- convergence to about 7 protest articles after a week -- long-term convergence unclear
- no method suggests that no-protest goes down in the long term

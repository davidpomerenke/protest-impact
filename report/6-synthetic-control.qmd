## Causal analysis via synthetic control {#sec-synth}

$$
Y_r = \beta + \beta_X X_r + \beta_W W_r + \beta_U U + \beta_{UX}^T (X_r U^T) \beta_{XU}
$$

with m-dimensional vectors $\beta_{UX}, X_r$ and n-dimensional vectors $\beta_{XU}, U$, so their product term in the equation above is scalar.

The counterfactual:

$$
Y_r(0) = \beta + \beta_X X_r + \beta_U U + \beta_{UX}^T (X_r U^T) \beta_{XU}
$$

Assumptions:

Let $R_0 = \{r \in R|W_r=0\}$ be the set of control regions.

1. $\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s = 1$
2. $E(\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s X_s) = X_r$

Interpolation from other regions, $\hat Y_r(0) &= \sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s Y_s$ as estimator.

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(\hat Y_r(0)) &= E\left(\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s Y_s\right) \\
&= E\left\{\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s \left[\beta + \beta_X X_s + \beta_U U + \beta_{UX}^T (X_r U^T) \beta_{XU} \right]\right\} \\
&= \beta + \beta_U U + \beta_X E\left(\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s  X_s\right) + \beta_{UX}^T \left[E\left(\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s X_r \right) U^T\right] \beta_{XU} && \text{By assumption 1} \\
&= \beta + \beta_X X_r + \beta_U U + \beta_{UX}^T (X_r U^T) \beta_{XU} && \text{By assumption 2} \\
&= Y_r(0)
\end{aligned}
$$

Weights $\gamma$ can be obtained by "upside down regression" [@facurealvesCausalInferenceBrave2022, ch. 15], that is, by performing OLS regression without intercept to estimate $E(X_r)=\gamma_1 X_1 + ... + \gamma_n X_n$ for the control regions $1...n=R_0$. Since the available control regions vary from day to day, many regressions have to be run.^[The number of models to be estimated is asympotically exponential in the number of regions, but the number of regions is small.] The number of samples for each regression may be small, leading to a large variance for $\hat Y_r(0)$ and making systematic bias more likely.

<!-- This is location-based matching

Alternative: @MatrixProfileStumpy for time-based matching. But: would assume that confounders are time-invariant, not plausible; or that they are fully caught somehow by the time series, also not too plausible.

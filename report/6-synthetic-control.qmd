## Causal analysis via synthetic control {#sec-synth}

_Factor model_ [similar to @abadieSyntheticControlMethods2010]:

$$
Y_r = \beta + \beta_X X_r + \beta_W W_r + \beta_U U + \sum_{i=0}^{|X_r|} \sum_{j=0}^{|U|} \beta_{UX,ij} (X_r U^T)_{ij}
$$

where $Y_r$ is the outcome for region $r$, $X_r$ is a vector of covariates of region $r$, $U$ is a vector of unknown global confounders, and $X_r U^T$ is a $|X_r|\times |U|$ matrix of interactions between the regional covariates and the unknown global confounders; and $\beta, \beta_X, \beta_W, \beta_U, \beta_{UX}$ are global parameters of the model (with sizes that correspond to the respective variables) that specify the impact of the variables.

The counterfactual:

$$
Y_r(0) = \beta + \beta_X X_r + \beta_U U + \sum_{i=0}^{|X_r|} \sum_{j=0}^{|U|} \beta_{UX,ij} (X_r U^T)_{ij}
$$

Assumptions:

Let $R_0 = \{r \in R|W_r=0\}$ be the set of control regions. Let us assume the existence of scalar weights $\gamma_s$ for all $s \in R_0$ that allow the interpolation of the covariates of the treatment region from the covariates of the control region:

1. $\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s = 1$
2. $E(\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s X_s) = X_r$

Interpolation from other regions, $\hat Y_r(0) &= \sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s Y_s$ as estimator.

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(\hat Y_r(0)) &= E\left(\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s Y_s\right) \\
&= E\left\{\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s \left[\beta + \beta_X X_s + \beta_U U + \sum_{i=0}^{|X_r|} \sum_{j=0}^{|U|} \beta_{UX,ij} (X_s U^T)_{ij} \right]\right\} \\
&= \beta + \beta_X E\left(\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s  X_s\right) + \beta_U U + \sum_{i=0}^{|X_r|} \sum_{j=0}^{|U|} \beta_{UX,ij} \left[E\left(\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s  X_s\right) U^T\right]_{ij} && \text{by assumption 1} \\
&= \beta + \beta_X X_r + \beta_U U + \sum_{i=0}^{|X_r|} \sum_{j=0}^{|U|} \beta_{UX,ij} (X_s U^T)_{ij} && \text{by assumption 2} \\
&= Y_r(0)
\end{aligned}
$$

Weights $\gamma$ can be obtained by "upside down regression" [@facurealvesCausalInferenceBrave2022, ch. 15] to estimate $E(X_r)=\gamma_1 X_1 + ... + \gamma_n X_n$ for the control regions $1...n=R_0$. In principle, we can use OLS or nonnegative least squares (NLS) for the estimation. However, this allows the model to _extrapolate_ rather than _interpolate_ between the control regions. To estimate weights that interpolate (that is, they are positive and sum up to 1), we can define a loss function $\left|X_r - \sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s X_s\right|$ and minimize it subject to the positivity and sum constraints on the weights, for example by using quadratic programming as minimization technique [@facurealvesCausalInferenceBrave2022, ch. 15; @abadieSyntheticControlMethods2010].

Since the available control regions vary from day to day, many regressions have to be run.^[The number of models to be estimated is asympotically exponential in the number of regions, but the number of regions is small.] The number of samples for each regression may be small, leading to a large variance for $\hat Y_r(0)$ and making systematic bias more likely.

$X_r$ may be chosen to either represent (static) fundamental data about the regions that is suspected to be predictive of treatment or outcome [@abadieSyntheticControlMethods2010]; or it can just be previous time-serious information about the outcome and other variables [@facurealvesCausalInferenceBrave2022, ch. 15].

<!-- This is location-based matching

Alternative: @MatrixProfileStumpy for time-based matching. But: would assume that confounders are time-invariant, not plausible; or that they are fully caught somehow by the time series, also not too plausible.

## Causal analysis via synthetic control {#sec-synth}

### Global confounding

$$
Y_r = \beta + \beta_X X_r + \beta_W W_r + \beta_U U
$$

$$
Y_r(0) = \beta + \beta_X X_r + \beta_U U
$$

### Restricted regional confounding

$$
Y_r = \beta + \beta_X X_r + \beta_W W_r + \beta_U U + \beta_{UX}^T (X_r U^T) \beta_{XU}
$$

with m-dimensional vectors $\beta_{UX}, X_r$ and n-dimensional vectors $\beta_{XU}, U$, so their product term in the equation above is scalar.

The counterfactual:

$$
Y_r(0) = \beta + \beta_X X_r + \beta_U U + \beta_{UX}^T (X_r U^T) \beta_{XU}
$$

Assumptions:

Let $R_0 = \{r \in R|W_r=0\}$ be the set of control regions.

1. $\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s = 1$
2. $\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s X_s = X_r$

Interpolation from other regions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat Y_r(0) &= \sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s Y_s \\
&= \sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s \left(\beta + \beta_X X_s + \beta_U U + \beta_{UX}^T (X_r U^T) \beta_{XU} \right) \\
&= \beta + \beta_U U + \beta_X \sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s  X_s + \beta_{UX}^T \left[\left(\sum_{s \in R_0} \gamma_s X_r \right) U^T\right] \beta_{XU} && \text{By assumption 1} \\
&= \beta + \beta_X X_r + \beta_U U + \beta_{UX}^T (X_r U^T) \beta_{XU} && \text{By assumption 2} \\
&= Y_r(0)
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- This is location-based matching

Alternative: @MatrixProfileStumpy for time-based matching. But: would assume that confounders are time-invariant, not plausible; or that they are fully caught somehow by the time series, also not too plausible.

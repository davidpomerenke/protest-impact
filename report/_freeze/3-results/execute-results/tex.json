Metrics for the OLS and the regularized regression models are shown in @tbl-reg-hypopt. Even though the bias is minimized, it is still substantial at around -14 articles within a timespan of one week. (This is only for time-series splits; the bias for conventional shuffled cross-validation splits is very close to 0 for all models.) A regression table with coefficients is appended in @sec-app1-reg.\n\n| Model          | Hyp. opt. obj. | RMSE          | Bias         |\n| -------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ------------ |\n| OLS            | min RMSE       | 110.6 ± 24.2  | -18.8 ± 10.4 |\n| OLS            | min bias       | 130.9 ± 21.5  | -14.3 ± 10.1 |\n| BayesianRidge  | min bias       | 119.7 ± 23.4  | -3.85 ± 15.2 |\n| LassoLarsIC    | min bias       | 118.9 ± 24.5  | -2.89 ± 15.7 |\n\n: Bias (mean error) and root mean squared error (RMSE) as a measure for variance for the best models that result from hyperparameter optimization. {#tbl-reg-hypopt}\n\n\n\n\n#### Instrumental variables\n\n\\begingroup\n\\footnotesize\\selectfont\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=20}\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}\n\\toprule\n{} &     cov\\_w &      cov\\_y &          wald &    corr\\_y \\\\\n\\midrule\ncovid\\_residential\\_lag0           & -0.012150 & -18.146569 &   1493.499309 & -0.205774 \\\\\ncovid\\_workplaces\\_lag0            &  0.011558 &  18.120331 &   1567.749666 &  0.205477 \\\\\ncovid\\_transit\\_stations\\_lag0      &  0.009238 &  19.079105 &   2065.295528 &  0.216349 \\\\\ncovid\\_retail\\_and\\_recreation\\_lag0 &  0.009151 &  17.686456 &   1932.761684 &  0.200557 \\\\\nweather\\_tmin\\_lag0                &  0.007102 &   5.738176 &    807.946903 &  0.065068 \\\\\ncovid\\_parks\\_lag0                 &  0.006466 &   7.383465 &   1141.847278 &  0.083725 \\\\\nweather\\_tavg\\_lag0                &  0.004919 &   3.309023 &    672.703296 &  0.037523 \\\\\ncovid\\_stringency\\_index\\_lag0      & -0.004649 & -16.934497 &   3642.728007 & -0.192030 \\\\\nweather\\_wspd\\_lag0                & -0.004630 & -10.515759 &   2271.452276 & -0.119244 \\\\\nweather\\_snow\\_lag0                & -0.004074 &  -5.183670 &   1272.279137 & -0.058781 \\\\\ncovid\\_grocery\\_and\\_pharmacy\\_lag0  &  0.003833 &  19.442073 &   5072.437659 &  0.220465 \\\\\nweather\\_wpgt\\_lag0                & -0.003388 &  -9.200765 &   2715.868619 & -0.104333 \\\\\nweather\\_tmax\\_lag0                &  0.003221 &   2.093490 &    650.008209 &  0.023739 \\\\\nweather\\_pres\\_lag0                & -0.002164 &   1.717007 &   -793.284370 &  0.019470 \\\\\nweather\\_prcp\\_lag0                &  0.001849 &   1.537868 &    831.906303 &  0.017439 \\\\\nweather\\_tsun\\_lag0                & -0.000209 &  -3.537210 &  16894.947751 & -0.040110 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\endgroup\n\nOut of the 15 potential instrumental variables, 5 pandemic instruments and 4 weather instruments have a statistically significant impact on protest occurrence (see @fig-iv-basic), but when using them in a combined regression the coefficients are much less significant. Precipitation is not among the significant variables.\n\nAutomatically binarizing the variables based on an optimally chosen threshold does not generally increase the coefficients and siginificances, and decreases them slightly in most cases. This is also true for precipiation: The optimal threshold for maximizing the covariance with protest occurrence is at prcp > 0, which is consistent with the choice in most related work (see @sec-weatherlit). I find that such binarization is not systematically better or worse than using the continuous value. (For the single regression, it slightly decreases the coefficient, and for the combined regression with other variables it slightly increases the coefficient.)\n\n::: {.cell .column-page execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Principal components of the](3-results_files/figure-pdf/fig-iv-pc-output-1.svg){#fig-iv-pc}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<!-- pc_0 at p=0.0005, pc_7 at p=0.007, and pc_11 at p=0.008 -->\n\nPrincipal component decomposition isolates three very significant components with p<0.01, while the other components have p>0.05.^[This is without adjusting for multiple testing since no hypothesis tests or thresholds are used, but the analysis is rather exploratory.] The three components are displayed in terms of the original variables in @fig-iv-pc.\n\n::: {.cell .column-page execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Principal components of the](3-results_files/figure-pdf/fig-iv-pc-deseasoned-output-1.svg){#fig-iv-pc-deseasoned}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDeseasoning the original variables and then performing separate principle component analyses on seasonal and residual parts shows that most of the significant variables are seasonal in nature; but there is also one very significant residual variable pc_resid_9 at p=0.0005 and two somewhat significant residual variables pc_resid_8 at p=0.05 and pc_resid_11 at p=0.07, while all other residual components have p>0.15 (without adjusting for multiple testing). The more significant components are broken down in @fig-iv-pc-deseasoned. The first-stage f-statistic for pc_resid_9 is f=33.82; f=2.08 for pc_resid_8; and f=2.02. According to the \"rule of thumb\" (@InstrumentalVariablesEstimation2023) the threshold for weak instruments is around f=10, so pc_resid_9 would be a strong instrument but the other ones would all be weak. The combined f-statistic of the three mentioned components is f=38.74.\n\nPlacebo tests for the first stage (the impact of the instrument on the treatment) are given in @fig-iv-1-placebo.

This results in F1=0.118 for my dataset.\n\nThe best logistic regression model achieves a 5-fold time-series cross-validated score of F1=0.233±0.044, while a similar model with balanced class weights achieves F1=0.213±0.017.\n\n### Placebo tests\n\n@fig-placebo-outcome shows placebo tests for the outcome for all models.
